## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-phase]: React/Next.js 15 + Firebase backend (existing ekklesia-agora project); do not migrate
- [Pre-phase]: Video pipeline — Firebase Storage acceptable for prototype demo; never treated as production CDN (Mux deferred to post-blessing)
- [Pre-phase]: Firestore data model must be designed in Phase 1 before any feature development — fan-out feed pattern and likes as subcollections are required
- [Pre-phase]: DMCA agent registration ($6/year) must precede any user-uploaded content — even prototype demo for clergy
- [Pre-phase]: Seed content must be jurisdictionally balanced from day one; moderation decisions must benchmark against Seven Ecumenical Councils, not any one jurisdiction
- [Phase 01-foundation]: next-firebase-auth-edge v1.12 uses setAuthCookies/removeAuthCookies from next-firebase-auth-edge/next/cookies (not createSessionCookieOnLogin from lib/next/server)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Server Action used for setCustomUserClaims — keeps Admin SDK server-only, avoids exposing service account to client bundle
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Double /api/login POST pattern: first creates initial session cookie, second updates it after roleLevel:1 claim is set via Admin SDK
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Anti-enumeration: password reset always shows success message regardless of whether email exists (swallows auth/user-not-found)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Admin page uses getTokens() in Server Component for defense-in-depth role check beyond middleware
- [Phase 01-foundation]: roleAuditLog write:false in Firestore rules — Admin SDK only writes ensure audit log integrity
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Privilege escalation guard: non-super-admin callers cannot assign role >= own level
- [Phase 01-foundation]: CSS token testing via fs.readFileSync with regex assertions — no jsdom needed for static CSS content
- [Phase 02-social-core]: Jest 30 renamed --testPathPattern to --testPathPatterns (plural); all verify commands in Phase 2 plans must use the plural flag

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 3 flag:** Liturgical calendar data sourcing (OCA.org, ROCOR) — verify whether structured data APIs or downloadable datasets exist before Phase 4 planning begins
- **Phase 5 flag:** Public domain patristic text sources — resolve text sourcing strategy (pre-1928 translations from CCEL/Project Gutenberg) before Phase 6 planning begins
- **Legal prerequisite:** Register DMCA agent with U.S. Copyright Office before any video uploads or seed content goes live
